Inverse geometrical model for Nao.

Requirements:
    Eigen v.2
    GNU make

Note, that there are other versions of igm() function, the respective source
files are kept in a separate branch (or they can be regenerated using Maple): 
    https://github.com/asherikov/nao_igm/tree/experimental
All versions are described in detail in file 
    ./nao_model/MapleCodeGeneration/Readme_M.txt
In the current branch we use version 3, versions 1 and 2 use different 
Jacobian and the 4'th version is a bit slow.
